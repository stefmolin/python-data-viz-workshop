# Workshop Notebooks

This directory contains the notebooks for following along with the session. You should run the cells as we progress through the session. Each section contains exercises, which you should complete in the `workbook.ipynb` notebook.

| Section | Notebook |
| --- | --- |
| 0: Setup | `0-check_your_env.ipynb` |
| 1: Getting Started With Matplotlib | `1-getting_started_with_matplotlib.ipynb` |
| 2: Moving Beyond Static Visualizations | `2-animations.ipynb` |
| 3: Building Interactive Visualizations for Data Exploration | `3-interactivity.ipynb` |

**NOTE**: The `check_env.py` file will be used in `0-check_your_env.ipynb`, which you will use to check your setup. The `utils.py` file contains the `despine()` function that we will define in the first section along with a function for configuring our plotting backend.
