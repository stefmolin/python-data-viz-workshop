# Workshop Slides

This directory contains the notebooks used to generate the slides. The slides themselves can be found at [`stefaniemolin.com/python-data-viz-workshop`](https://stefaniemolin.com/python-data-viz-workshop/). To generate a PDF version of the slides, use [this link instead](https://stefaniemolin.com/python-data-viz-workshop/?print-pdf#/) to view the slides (be patient &ndash; it takes a while to load), and then use `ctrl + P` or `cmd + P` to print to a PDF file.
